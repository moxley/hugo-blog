- Stop and think before coding
- Start thinking about the top, find the foundation, then think about that.
- For each level, think about the layer below it
- For each component to develop, think about its dependencies it needs that haven't been developed yet.
  - Develop those first
- Clean commits
- git add .; git commit
- Integration last
