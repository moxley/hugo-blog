Notes:
- There seem to be very few resources to help understand the spec
  - Google: minimal
  - Stackoverflow: minimal
- Organize around data relationships and use cases
  - To-many
  - To-one
  - For each kind of relationship:
    - These are the endpoints you want to build
    - These are the use cases they cover
    - These are the user cases they _don't_ cover
- Use strict adherence to terminology presented by the spec, and link from each term
  instance to its definition in the spec
- Limitations and workarounds
